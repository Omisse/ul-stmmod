guide_window_smart_thread_manager,"Distributes CPU speed between connected nodes.[br]Bar in the middle represents [u][l]approximate[/l][/u] [l]supply/demand[/l] ratio and might be quite different depending on current distribution mode.[br]Distribution mode affects the behaviour of smart manager:[br][l]ratio[/l] one would fit best for lots of independent consumers,[br][l]graph[/l] achieves unmatched efficiency on long lines,[br][l]demand[/l] is faster than graph and is good enough for most linear cases."
guide_window_smart_thread_manager_ratio,"[h]Ratio mode[/h][br]Ratio mode is the simplest one: it just gives each consumer as much as it needs at the time, and equally divides values in case of low supply"
guide_window_smart_thread_manager_demand,"[h]Demand mode[/h][br]Demand mode satisfies demands from lowest to highest, but keeps internal ratio multiplier for each node. Works good for short lines, but struggles to stabilize on long ones."
guide_window_smart_thread_manager_graph,"[h]Graph mode[/h][br]Graph mode is the most complex and precise of all three: in that mode, manager knows how consumers depend on each other, and adjusts values so that on each separate line there will be closest to theoretically maximal production"
guide_window_smart_thread_manager_chaining,"[h]Chaining[/h][br]Smart Managers can be chained with their colleagues: in that case, supplying manager will know the demands of all receiving ones. Receiving managers get same treatment as consumers in ratio and demand modes, and as high-priority storages in graph mode."
